    <h2>Greetings, traveler!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio site. This is where I house each project I am working on or have completed. As I progress there will be more links added to the navigation to view. The entire site / file will be a work in progress so things will be changing and moving constantly. </p>
    
    <p>Here is more content for the website to view</p>

    <p><strong>Nov. 5th, 2024:</strong> Hoping to be able to add little flash games to this eventually. </p>

    <p><strong>Nov. 7th, 2024:</strong> Added a little leaf icon from font-awesome and fixed it's position.</p>

    <p><strong>Nov. 8th, 2024:</strong> Background images fixed for both here and Christmas. Collecting info and photos to add to the pages. Fix viewability in mobile / ipad view.</p>

    <p><strong>Nov. 11th, 2024:</strong> Changed the font to something a little easier on the eyes.</p>

    <h2>Interesting Weather Updates</h2>
    <p>It's November 7th, 2024 and it was 80+ degrees outside today. Sun is shinin' while the leaves are fallin'. We haven't had anything more than a 5 minute light drizzle in two months. I don't think we are going to see much snow this year either with the outlook being warmer than average for the Mid-Atlantic.</p>

    <p>As of November 8th there are three big wildfires going on in NJ. One up in Jackson near Six Flags, one in the Evesham-Voorhees area, and another in the Glassboro Wildlife Management Area. Today is supposed to be terrible for the winds... Hopefully the rain they're predicting on Sunday actually comes.</p>

    <p>Monday, November 11th! We got rain last night! It wasn't a drought-changing amount but it was a steady light rain for a good few hours so that's something. Although this smoke is truly nothing compared to last year with the major wildfires up north. It looked apocalyptic. </p>

    <h2><strong>Potential Update Journal Log</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>11/8/24 -</strong> Possibly add a link to a page for completed art projects / projects in general. Definitely add an entire section just for Lila for giggles, maybe dress her up and take photos.</p>

    <p>Testing repository update.</p>
