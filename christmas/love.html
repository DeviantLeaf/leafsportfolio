    <h1>Merry Christmas, Grasshopper!</h1>
    <p>I couldn't figure out what gift would be best for you this year, so I decided to make you one while also trying to learn new things to brighten our future up a little bit if possible. I hope you enjoy the little things I've put around the site. We can always add and remove whatever you want. </p>
    <p>I hope you like your homemade gift. I love you very much!</p>
