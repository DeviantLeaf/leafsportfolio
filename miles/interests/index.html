    <h1>Leafy's Somewhat Interesting Interests</h1>

    <p>I enjoy many different hobbies but my favorites are cooking, crocheting and camping! Although camping is only in the spring/summer time, that's okay because that leaves plenty of time to work on other things. I also love to read and watch movies. Growing up my grandfather had hundreds of movies on VHS tapes, three to a tape! I remember having to rewind and fast forward to get to the movies we wanted to watch as kids.</p>

    <p>In order to get to Hocus Pocus you'd have to fast forward through Huckleberry Finn. I think I saw that movie hundreds of times before actually watching it. When those fancy VHS rewinders came out it made life a lot easier. They didn't last that long though because soon enough my grandfather was on to collecting DVDs. He eventually donated the VHS collection to the nurisng home where my Mom Mom lived prior to her passing.</p>
