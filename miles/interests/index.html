    <h1>Leafy's Somewhat Interesting Interests</h1>

    <p>I enjoy many different hobbies but my favorites are cooking, crocheting and camping! Although camping is only in the spring/summer time, that's okay because that leaves plenty of time to work on other things. I also love to read and watch movies. Growing up my grandfather had hundreds of movies on VHS tapes, three to a tape! I remember having to rewind and fast forward to get to the movies we wanted to watch as kids.</p>

    <p>In order to get to Hocus Pocus you'd have to fast forward through Huckleberry Finn. I think I saw that movie hundreds of times before actually watching it. When those fancy VHS rewinders came out it made life a lot easier. They didn't last that long though because soon enough my grandfather was on to collecting DVDs. He eventually donated the VHS collection to the nurisng home where my Mom Mom lived prior to her passing.</p>

    <p>Do you like cooking? Over the years with my husband I have learned to appreciate more of the flavors that the world has to offer. Thankfully that means not only has my taste evolved but so have my cooking skills. They're not totally excellent but fair. I can certainly at least attempt to throw down with someone in the kitchen! </p>

    <p>Check out some of my favorites below.</p>

    <section id="eggs">
        <h2>Breakfast</h2>
        <p>Breakfast food is truly my favorite food. I grew up in and out of the diners that my momma worked at and let me tell YOU. There is nothing better than walkin' into a diner and smellin' that aromatic coffee dripping and the breakfast sizzling on the griddle. Who ever has a bad time at a diner?! It's a damn shame they are falling out of favor around the country but I am awfully proud that southern NJ has succeeded in keeping them alive.</p>

        <p>My favorite breakfast in the world is scrambled eggs, home fries with crispy fried onions, crispy bacon and some toast. Don't forget the coffee and OJ.</p>

    <section id="soup">
        <h2>Soup</h2>
        <p>What's better than a hot and delicious soup on a cold autumn or winter's day? Add some homemade bread in there and you're good to go for all eternity. Mmmm, soup.... Sorry, anyway! My favorite soups are potato soup, chicken soup and beef stew. They are all super easy to make in my pressure cooker or on the stove. I prefer my Ninja Foodi because it's faster to make dinner when I get home from work. </p>

        <p>I personally like to use red potatoes and russet potatoes. Easy to remember, red n' russet! The red potatoes will stay together whereas the russett will kind of stay but also help to thicken your soup. Don't forget your seasonings either, that's what makes the soup even MORE delicious! Don't cheat yourself, love yourself! Respect yourself!</p>

    <section id="bread">
        <h2>Bread</h2>
        <p>Bread is so easy and fun to make whether you're kneading it by hand or letting the mixer do the hard work. You can bake it or you can use the crockpot. Recently I have been trying my hand at slow cooking the bread on high. I brushed some olive oil on top prior to starting and it came out tasting like the most perfect bread to have with a spaghetti dinner. Or stuffed shells!</p>

        <p>The options with baking bread feel endless. My next attempt will likely be a baanana bread. Good thing I always have some bananas on hand. </p>

    <section id="roast">
        <h2>Sunday Roast</h2>
        <p>We call it a Sunday roast but it can really be an any-day roast. You can cook it, slow cook it, or smoke it! I don't really have a favorite beacuse they're all so delicious in their own way. I'll never ever forget the way my grandparent's Sunday roast smelled and tasted though. There truly is something magical about it and it's one of my favorite childhood meals.</p>

    <section id="burgers">
        <h2>Smashburgers and BBQ</h2>
        <p>One of the best things about camping every weekend in the summer is the food. We have a seasonal site so we bring our smoker every summer and feast with our friends in the compound. We have only recently started making them since a food truck came to the campground. Obviously we can't chase the truck around all summer long so we started making our own. While they are not nearly as tasty as Shep's Cosmic Kitchen, they are still pretty dang good!</p>

        <p>We also enjoy smoking ribs, chicken, veggies and even eggs! I love a good smoked egg - just like a hard boiled egg but way tastier. I highly recommend it. Pretty much anything you can BBQ you can smoke.</p>
