    <h1>Leafy's Somewhat Interesting Interests</h1>

    <p>I enjoy many different hobbies but my favorites are cooking, crocheting and camping! Although camping is only in the spring/summer time, that's okay because that leaves plenty of time to work on other things. I also love to read and watch movies. Growing up my grandfather had hundreds of movies on VHS tapes, three to a tape! I remember having to rewind and fast forward to get to the movies we wanted to watch as kids.</p>

    <p>In order to get to Hocus Pocus you'd have to fast forward through Huckleberry Finn. I think I saw that movie hundreds of times before actually watching it. When those fancy VHS rewinders came out it made life a lot easier. They didn't last that long though because soon enough my grandfather was on to collecting DVDs. He eventually donated the VHS collection to the nurisng home where my Mom Mom lived prior to her passing.</p>

    <h2>Cooking</h2>

    <p>Do you like cooking? Over the years with my husband I have learned to appreciate more of the flavors that the world has to offer. Thankfully that means not only has my taste evolved but so have my cooking skills. They're not totally excellent but fair. I can certainly at least attempt to throw down with someone in the kitchen! </p>

    <p>Check out some of my favorites below.</p>

        <h2>Breakfast</h2>
        <p>Breakfast food is truly my favorite food. I grew up in and out of the diners that my momma worked at and let me tell YOU. There is nothing better than walkin' into a diner and smellin' that aromatic coffee dripping and the breakfast sizzling on the griddle. Who ever has a bad time at a diner?! It's a damn shame they are falling out of favor around the country but I am awfully proud that southern NJ has succeeded in keeping them alive.</p>
