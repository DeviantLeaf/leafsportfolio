        <p>That's my girl, Lila Mae. She too enjoys laying out in the sun on the dirt. She also loves to go swimming in the nearby lake. The majority of her energy expenditure during the summer is swimming in the pool or lake, running with her friends or baking in the sun. What more could the goodest girl ask for?</p>

        <p>We started camping a couple of years ago and fell in love with it just as much as my family did before I was even born. My great grandmother has travelled far and wide in campers and a motorhome. She and my great uncle Gary sold thier house in NJ to go travel for a few years. Eventually they settled in Ephrata, PA until her passing many years later. Great uncle Gary now lives back in NJ, not far from where we live actually. I am excited to have him over for Thanksgiving this year with the family.</p>
