    <h1>What Leafy Does</h1>
    <p><img src="images/office.jpg" alt="job" width="500px" height="333px"></p>

    <p>I am an office manager for a small company that is looking to switch career paths. I used to play with HTML and CSS as a kid but now I may be interested in taking it further, hence this project. I have been at the same place since September of 2015 which is just shy of ten years. Prior to that, I worked in the insurance department of medical collections handling claims, filing bills, etc. This lead to becoming an independent contractor for the same collection company doing data entry from home. </p>
